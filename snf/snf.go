/*
Package snf is a wrapper for SNF library to support direct interaction
with Myricom/CSPI boards.

The purpose of the package is to avoid using libpcap-wrapped SNF
functionality in favor of more flexible and full-featured SNF C
binding.

In order to be able to use google/gopacket (layers etc.)
functionality, some interfaces in those packages are satisfied. Any
feature requests regarding extension of such integration are welcomed.

Some examples are provided to show various use cases, features,
limitations and so on.
