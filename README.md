Go wrappers for SNFv3 library supplied by CSPI for Myricom PCI-E network boards.

### Installation
Non-Go requirements:
* SNFv3, please refer to [CSPI](http://www.cspi.com) website for download and installation instructions.
* `libpcap` library and include headers. Consult your system documentation on how to install them.
* Tested on Linux environment only (Centos 7, Ubuntu Trusty).

### SNF library location
If you have SNF library installed in default location `/opt/snf` then you can simply build as it is.
If you want to test something in case you don't have installed SNF dependency you can specify `snf_mockup` build tag. In this case, all SNF calls will be implemented as stub functions.

Alternatively, you can specify SNF library custom location by supplying it in environment:
```
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I/path/to/snf/include"
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/snf/lib -lsnf"
```

Library may also be linked statically by using `snf_static` tag.

### Caveats
* The package is under development so API may experience some changes. Any contributions from Myricom NICs users are welcome.
* `libsnf` library doesn't support position-independent executables. If gcc requires, specify `-no-pie` option in `CGO_CFLAGS`.
